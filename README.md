The code was written by TERESIAH MWANGI

This program reads an infix expression from the user, converts it to postfix notation using the shunting-yard algorithm, and evaluates the postfix expression to obtain the result.

Features
Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulo (%).
Handles parentheses to ensure correct order of operations.
Properly handles multi-digit operands.

How It Works:
The program first converts the infix expression to postfix notation using the shunting-yard algorithm.
It then evaluates the postfix expression using a stack-based approach to perform arithmetic operations.
Proper handling of multi-digit operands ensures correct evaluation of expressions with numbers greater than 9.
